## About Me ##

My name is **Ryan**, but I go by the name **Ryclic** online. I'm currently a high schooler and have my interests set in the realm of cybersecurity. \
Some of my other interests include playing the clarinet, gaming, video editing, and tinkering with electronics. 

## Purpose ##

This blog is intended to be a place for me to document any interesting discoveries or topics that I will stumble upon. These might include: 
* HackTheBox or TryHackMe box writeups
* CTF writeups
* New technologies 

For the time being, I'm interested in web exploitation, reverse engineering, and malware analysis.
