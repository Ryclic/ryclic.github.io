## Preface
The binary bomb lab is a well known program that tests skills of reading and understanding assembly as well as reversing programs. 

It is commonly used in college level classes as a final project or exercise to test on learned material.

The program has multiple stages, each of which the participant must find the answer to in order to "defuse" the bomb. 

If the answer is wrong, the bomb will "explode".

Let's get defusing!
