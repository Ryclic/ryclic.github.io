## Personal Info

My name is **Ryan**, but I go by the name **Ryclic** online. I'm a current high schooler in the US.

Besides computer science, some of my other interests include playing the clarinet, calisthenics, gaming, and video editing.

## Purpose

This blog is intended to be a place for me to document any interesting discoveries or topics that I stumble upon. These might include: 
* HackTheBox or TryHackMe box writeups
* CTF writeups
* Projects

For the time being, I'm interested in binary exploitation, embedded security, and malware analysis.
